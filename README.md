# Weather App

This is a simple weather application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Notes

- Ensure you have the required API keys configured in the `.env.local` file.
- This version of the app uses unoptimized images. Consider optimizing them for better performance.
- For production, use `npm run build` and `npm start`.

Enjoy exploring the weather!
